Review Exercise 2see https://controlc.com/8f732f61
================= all my code to date is here: https://github.com/onionmccabbage/AEMJavaFeb2021
In a new package, create a Java program called 'Review2'
Ask the user to guess a random integer between 0-100
They are allowed ten guesses, then tell them the answer
Each guess should respond 'too high', 'too low' or 'correct'

Architecture
------------
You can do this all in one Java file, or you could use two (or more) modules as you wish
E.g. a module could encapsulate the engine to generate the random number, (and to say if it is odd or even)
You would then use that module in a run-able Java program that actually plays the game

Optional
--------
If the user types -1 then give hints such as 'even' or 'odd'
If the user types -2 then tell them the answer and end the program
Entering -3 should start a new game
Store each guess in an array and at the end print out the guesses
Find a way to let the user choose the game difficulty (0-100, 0-1000, 0-10000 etc)
Maybe a separate (non-runable) module could encapsulate the game config, such as number of guesses, difficulty range
and the array which stores the guesses as they are made

NB cast something as an int like this:
  int myint = (int) someNumber;
