Review Exrecise 5
=================
If possible, create a package hierchy for this project
Separate code into modules containing your enums and classes and write one runnable class
Spend a short time designing a structure to represent a brand, including (for example):
  Brand name, logo image, prices(annual or monthly), features(legal-cover, discount, excess), blurb, 
  conditions(min-age, region, combine-with)
Decide on data-types for each of these properties
Some will make good enums or classes, so write them in separate modules
Some will be simple values such as String or double
(You can use my starter-code in the github repository, but do think about the strucure and change mine as you see fit)

Start small, with one enum or class then add others when the whole thing is working
For the purposes of this exercise, it's a good idea to use the constructor to provide sensible default values
(Saves lots of typing when you make instances later)

What does 'comparable' mean here? 
Within your Brand class, write a function to return the equality of two instances, based on their property values

In your runnable class, create two instances (or more)
Compare the instances and print out the result

Optional
--------
Compare several instances and print only those that are comparable
Also print those which are nearly comparable i.e. if the user is willing to accept slight differences then they should consider...
Use jar to make all your compiled classes and enums into an archive
  e.g. jav -cf out.jar c1.class c2.class c3.class ...
