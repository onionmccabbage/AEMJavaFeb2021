Binary
128/64/32/16/8421
 00000001 = 1
 00010101 = 21
 00111111 = 63 (one less than 64)
8 digits in a byte
11111111 = 255 (one less than 256)

Thursday
> JAR files - try to install AEM via JAR
> AEM stuff
> pass by ref pass by value
> Strings are immutable
> The JCR
> after lunch review exercise
> try-catch

Friday
- brief review
- IntelliJ Idea
- look again at CRXDE i.e. the web interface - using JAR, also single/multi....
- JAR Files: populating Java Archive (JAR) files, examples from AEM
- Arrays - overview of AEM configuration collections
- Enumerators
- Encapsulation and Packages
- packages and the classpath
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Composition, Interface
Inheritance - child-parent relationship - reuseable code, overload/overwrite hiding
Polymorphism - use same method with different outcomes e.g. pet inc cat, dog, fish, aardvark return relevant stuff
Encapsulate - different constructors to enable class to be used as needed. Default values (signature) access/mutator get/set
Composition - class has objects as variables which compose it. Break down complexity into other objects. Combine lower level objects into a 
higher order class
Composition is preferred over inheritance.
Inheritance base class must manage all the child classes - can rapidly become too many derived classes
Composition - small encapsulated classes - granularity
- Abstract classes, interfaces
- Optional extension
  - Running AEM from a JAR, exploring the structure, Nodes and the JCR
  - Ways to configure AEM: JAR-naming, command-line, XML, JSON, JCR nodes, admin-interface
  - debug and test
  - Exceptions in Java 
- junit for unit testing Java. Also Mockito for creating mocks. What are the tools we use?
