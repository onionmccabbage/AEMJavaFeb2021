Wednesday
- brief review
- check Aaliyah Java is ok within VS Code
- IntelliJ
> other providers of Java
- debug
> packages
- How Java differs from JavaScript
  - Data types, return types, encapsulation and inheritance
- Working within the rigour of a strongly typed language
- Error and Exception Handling
- Method Definitions, Arguments and Return Types 
- Overloading Methods and Method Invocations 
- AEM Maven Archetype
- Class Inheritance 
- Implementing Inheritance 
- Casting and Inheritance 
- The super variable 
- Constructors and Inheritance 
- after lunch review exercise
- tools for compiling and for creating JAR files 

- other loops e.g. while, do-while


Thursday
- pass by ref pass by value
- Strings are immutable
- packages and the classpath
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Composition, Interface
Inheritance - child-parent relationship  -reuseable code, overload/overwrite hiding
Polymorphism - use same method with different outcomes e.g. pet inc cat, dog, fish, aardvark return relevant stuff
Encapsulate - different constructors to enable class to be used as needed. Default values (signature) access/mutator get/set
Composition - class has objects as variables which compose it. Break down complexity into other objects. Combine lower level objects into a 
higher order class
 composition is preferred over inheritance.
Inheritance base class must manage all the child classes - can rapidly become too many derived classes
Composition - small encapsulated classes - granularity
- Abstract classes, interfaces
- The JCR
- after lunch review exercise

Friday
- Packages: Declaring Packages, Role of the Classpath 
- Encapsulation and Packages
- JAR Files: populating Java Archive (JAR) files, examples from AEM
- Constants, Enumerators and Arrays
- Arrays - Creating arrays, Accessing Array Elements, Overview of AEM configuration collections
- Exercise: build and use JAR files 
- Optional extension matter@
  - Running AEM from a JAR, exploring the Java structure, Nodes and the JCR
  - Ways to configure AEM: JAR-naming, command-line, XML, JSON, JCR nodes, admin-interface
  - debug and test
  - Exception types in Java
