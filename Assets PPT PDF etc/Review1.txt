Java Review Exercise 1 https://controlc.com/f0dff272
====================== until about 2:20-2:30 ish
Use this as the basis of a short review exercise. Opportunities to screen-share code at the end!

Create a new Java file called Review1
Write the code needed for a runnable class called 'Review1'
Import the Scanner class and declare a variable to hold an instance of the Scanner
Within the 'main' method, declare two variables which will each hold a floating point number
Populate these variables from values entered by the user using nextFloat()
Also declare variables which will hold the difference, product and ratio of the two numbers
					(     -	         *           /   )

Print a line asking the user to enter two numbers
Then use the scanner to grab the next two floating point numbers entered by the user
Calculate the difference, product and ratio of the two numbers and store in your variables
Print a nicely formatted statement showing the results
Remember to close the scanner instance

Compile and execute the program

Optional
--------
Consider the two numbers to be the 'x' and 'y' values of a right-angled triangle
Calculate and show the hypotenuse 'r':

	r = Math.sqrt( (x*x)+(y*y) )

So if x=3 and y=4 then r=5.0
