Review Exercise 3 until 3:30 ish
================= see https://controlc.com/26f6fa6e
Build a suite of modules within packages to be used in customer-facing pages 
  E.g. web pages, advertising or social media posts
You top-level class should include basic "Page" properties such as "pageName" and "language"

The constructors should accept values for the properties and you should provide getter/setter methods
In the setter methods check that the provided value is not an empty string. If it is, provide default content

Then extend the top-level class to declare classes for "HomePage" and "UserPage" where
"HomePage" includes properties for "isLoggedIn" and "maxNumberOfAdverts" and
"UserPage" includes properties for "userName" and "timeOutCountdown"
Make decisions about what data types to use for properties and for method return-types

Also implement "Default Page Content" and "Additional Page Content" properties as you see fit

Write getter and setter methods for all the properties, and sanitize their values
  E.g. "maxNumberOfAdverts" must be greater than zero (and maybe less than some maximum)

Write two more methods, both called "extendContent". One should extend the existing content with some default text, 
the other should accept additional content, to be added to the existing content

You will need a run-able class to exercise your code and prove it works as intended
  E.g. create instances of the page, home page, and user page with relevant properties

Aim for DRY code and use final (constants) where appropriate

Optional
--------
Use @Override to declare your own version of the toString() method, which should nicely print the instance details 
Provide an array of advert names as a property of one of your classes (decide where this should be in the hierachy)
  E.g. private String[] ads = {"Three", "EE", "Vodafone", "Orange"}
Show these advert names in a print-out of the page details
Limit the array to whatever is set as "maxNumberOfAdverts"
Consider other properties we might know about a page visitor and find ways to include those data
